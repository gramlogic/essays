What was the point of teaching this class?

The threat of trump is an attack against the authority of institutions that produce knowledge of the world, and an attack on the sum total of that knowledge.

The project of philosophy was to guard against this possibility by establishing secure knowledge: that is, truth. What no one could reasonably deny. The thing that distinguishes knowledge from belief.

But it turned out that there were more things that we could deny than were once believed.
It is not simply a matter of getting "more" educated or reading more deeply.

To achieve the security of truth, philosophers needed a foundation consisting of undeniable claims and rules for reaching conclusions (one can think of the rules themselves as founding assumptions).

Plato's idea is that this world of true essences appears to us as sensible shadows, but that we can work backward to divine the forms.
* So there is the sensible and the intelligible.
* The sensible is what we perceive.
* The intelligible is the domain of the forms (truth).
* The intelligible is superior. It is the source of the sensible.
* It is the object in itself that produces the sensory experience of the object.
* It is the entire world of the objective.
* It is the thing before perception. Noumena.
* It is what would be described by an ontology.

Unfortunately, we cannot engage with the world beyond our conception of it, by definition.

We have instead to work with an idea of the world. A model of the world.

This is the sum of true statements.
What is called knowledge. the episteme.
It should be like a mirror of that outside world. An interior replica.
It does not have to be a complete replica, but we require that everything in included is actually true. Nothing known to be false, but also nothing that is mere opinion or belief.
What this means is that every statement in the episteme must be linked somehow to the outside world.
One way to produce such a link is through empirical observation. What is called "evidence based".
* This is, essentially, the path of science.
* It is a bit difficult.
* And to some (Hume), it is troubling because no amount of observation can lead to true certainty. 
* In the sense that, it is always possibly that at some point in the future one will enounter an observation that disconfirms the theory. (black swan)
* So theories created in this way are always contigent.
* There is virtually no one contesting this, though a lot of people believe scientific knowledge is supplemented by another kind of knowledge that is more sure.
And so another way to proceed is through "formal reasoning".
* Note the tie to Plato's forms.
* What does Hume call this division? What does Russell call it?
* It seemed to many that even though many, or most statements were uncertain, we could come up with at least some of them that everyone could agree on.
* These would be our founding assumptions.
* Further, we could agree on a set of rules for producing new true statements based on statements we already know to be true. This is often called logic.
* I would make the minor modification that the set of rules is also part of the set of founding assumptions.
* This is, notably, Euclid's method.

The strength of this approach is that if we accept all the founding assumptions, we then accept everything that follows from them.
* It follows "automatically" even if it sometimes takes years or centuries to work out implications, even if it's never fully complete because new implications are always possible (not necessarily the case for every such system).

So again, we have this structure called the episteme, which is supposed to be a mirror of the world.
It works fundamentally by beginning with some seemingly incontrovertible assumptions about the world, then building from within a network of statements that, because they follow from the initial conditions, are themselves thought to be true statements about the world.

This gives us our little interior replica of the world.

And we can add to it also a collection of statements about which we are less certain. For example, that which appears to be confirmed by empirical verification.

But we place great value in this kernel of things we can know through pure reason, without relying on the sensible world.
And we have reduced the problem of defending every claim to just defending initial assumptions.

The problem of choosing and defending these initial assumptions is a problem of defining a metaphysics.
* It is a difficult problem.
* It is very important.
* This is where a philosophy is vulnerable to questioning.
* Nietzsche made this point most clearly: ethics does not follow from metaphysics.
* And philosophers often demonstrated their ability to critique other philosophers by questioning foundations in this way.

What Derrida shows is that the problem is not that philosophers have not yet achieved the right metaphysics, but that there is a structural deficiency in the approach. An inherent deficiency.
* This is the problem of the center.
* The supplement, etc.

## What this does and doesn't mean
* Identifying this problem does not mean throwing everything out and starting over.
* Indeed, this is exactly how we got here.
* Does not mean "nihilism"
* Or "there is no meaning"
* We are not saying that our interior model is unrelated to the world, only that the relation is one of belief rather than certainty.
  * It is no more secure than empirical sciences.

Rather, it means changing the way we think of the episteme.
* Untethered planet.
* No longer the direct representation of the thing
* Contingent, part of history.
* Must be defended.

It means the sign is no longer a connector between signifier and (true) signified real thing.
It is the signifier of a signifier.
In a world of belief.

It means that authority and credibiliy, and affinity in general play a greater role in verifying claims.
We have to look at motives and dreams of the speaker.

It means changing the meaning of a lot of words.
All those concepts that depended on the ability to make a clean break.
That rely on the "metaphysical assumption" that we can have this rooted structure.

We can get all the way here without speech and writing. Maybe it's enough.

Where did this idea of the forms come from?
We should look at logic.
And what this meant, the rules of logic, speech.
The sense of presence, immediacy, directness, liveness, clarity, immanence.
The system of hearing oneself speak.
Various types of deception --see writing.

What it is replaced with:
The signifier of the signifier.
Writing.
The sign of distance and delay
Also death, fixedness.
Determinacy.
Mechanism. Technique.

## Adventure
Willfully misleading
Erasing its own origin.
Ars adeo latet arte sua.
The self-denigrating art of realism.
The forgery--another favorite of Borges.

The paradox of the self here.
We conceal the mechanism and the history to create the effect of subjectivity.
We conceal the hand of the subject to create the effect of objectivity.
* That is, suppress aesthetics and desire (motive). Deliver something ugly and painful.
* There is certainly an aesthetics to the attack.
* Also a gratification of the ego.
* A complicated gratification because it has to pose as a kind of disappointment--an acceptance of certain ideas of discomfort (mostly to others) in exchange for more important comforts (ego, power, control, self-importance).
* I.e. a group that would rather believe they intentionally stabbed themselves in the leg than believe they have been healed against their will.

The cartoonish figure of Donald Trump, pretending to be his alias. A joke Borges could only have dreamed of.




This means it follows irrefutably from other true statements or it is inherently incontrovertible.



This world--reality--must be independent of the sensible world. 
* It is not affected by subjective perceptions or opinions, by definition.
* So ho





The idea of truth. The forms.

An invisible world beyond the sensible world.

All it requires is a firm foundation.

This would establish a direct link between signifier and signified.

There can be none.

So it turns out instead that this body of knowledge is really just a set of beliefs. One among others. It does not escape history or subjectivity.
It is never complete.

Its roots are in aesthetics and erotics.

We had hoped for a binary model: reality and language. This is the relationship the west attributed to speech.

What we got instead is a semiotics in which the sign is the signifier of the signifier. A description attributed to writing.

When this happens we can no longer "form the separations" which is to "erase the connections" require to establish independence. So everything becomes subjected to questions of causation.

This is where the foundations of logic fall back into history.


The argument is writing -> speech -> writing
The idea of reality, an idea that describes a concept beyond the self, is nonetheless an idea.

The ideal is the domain of the logos. The effort of the logos was to establish itself as the true vision. To advocate for the possibility of a single true vision that would be beyond assault. As part of this vision, the empirical world, and the laws that govern it.

What happened instead was a turning towards itself and the discovery that there was no way to establish the desired foundation.

Again:

We had some ideas about the world.
What we wanted to say was that these were not merely ideas, but the truth about the world.
We found ourselves unable to say this.
What happens next is complicated.
It means, on the one hand, that our idea of the world always remains merely an idea, one possibility among others.
It means, on the other hand, that if we preserve certain important aspects of this idea, that we find the idea itself to be the product of empirical forces.

In more detail:
Plato's view was that we looked at the empirical world to understand the truth beyond it. And that that true world of forms dictated the behavior of the empirical marks.

Nietzsche reverses this: the forms are constructed from the marks.

Derrida goes on to associate this with speech and writing. I have an idea of myself that comes from hearing myself speak, and becomes an idea of truth, presence, immediacy. Speech as the first sign.

Then I have an idea of the world that is part of this system. The world as it is inscribed in the self.

What is writing? Most importantly, it is a signifier of a signifier. A second sign. A representative of distance and delay. And no doubt empiricism, determinism. Contingency. What is programmed.

The implications of this inability to attain a privileged position:
* 

Without foundation, speech turns out to be better represented as a sign of a sign. A special kind of writing that tried to erase this characteristic.

This "trying to erase" is also creating the idea of speech.
 

What in this world we might say as
Ideas matter.

The world of Tlon might prefer to say
Matter ideates.

That the foundations of knowledge are found in desires and aesthetics.

What Nietzsche says: dreams hung on the back of a tiger.

Not the world, but the idea of the world, the world within us.

How does this work:

This first system of hearing-oneself-speak distinguishes between the idea of self, identified with voice, immediacy, presence, what presents itself to us at first as a non-physicality of sound and thought. Divided from the idea of the world, that is, the other, over which we do not have immediate control, which manifests itself to us as the visible, tangible things that move of their own accord, and exert force against us.

The interpretation of this external world has come to be aligned with the most expansive meaning of the word "reading," and in keeping with this use of the word, the world itself is a kind of writing. The world as text. Perhaps this has never been better visualized than in the imagination of the Matrix: represented as traces of descending green text that form the world. Or another representation: Wallace Stevens' the Reader.

The self as voice:
This has already been explained.
* Also God.
* Also soul, later mind.
* The origin of responsibility.
But what grew from this dream was the dream of secure knowledge. A domain of the immediately intuitive, immaterial truth.
* Immanence:
* Because it was immediate--there was no time. This is the literal a priori that Descartes looked for inside himself.
* Because it was immaterial it did not rely on the world for confirmation. 
* What comes with it is the idea of "foundation" or origin itself.

Logocentrism:
The elevation of speech over writing. The belief that speech comes first. That writing (and by extension, the world) is only a representative of speech (by extension, the a priori). The material world is the realm of the fallen.
* Plato: through it, we can ascend to world of pure forms.
* It is not too far to see that the idea of the soul, of God, of earth and heaven are all expressions of this hierarchy.


Speech as artifice:
Turing, In viva voce

What are the implications?

* The structure of the episteme is not a tree of knowledge arising out of solid roots.
* It is instead like a planet, floating in space, untethered except to its own bulk.
  * It is nowhere static--new relations are always coming into being.
  * It is always expanding as part of the work of thought.
* When two such planets are placed into conflict (what Kuhn would have called paradigms), the conflict is fought on the grounds of aesthetics and desires.
* The dream that there is only one such world and that it has the power to elevate itself above all others is only the result of a past victory in a ruthless contest in which the winner expunged the names of its challengers from the book of life.

The old dream was that this structure could achieve full presence of voice.
But it turned out that what presented itself as presence was really an erasure of difference, a failure to perceive the mechanism and medium of speech.

Trump is related to critique of western metaphysics, which has always endeavored to prevent exactly this kind of catastrophe by providing a single, secure foundation for knowledge that would guarantee some set of claims. This creates the difference between knowledge and mere belief. This foundation is therefore inseparable from the idea of the episteme.

The Derridean critique is not the first critique of the foundations of western metaphysics, but it was perhaps the first to demonstrate that the problem was instrinsic to the endeavor. Not only were the foundations insufficient, they were inherently insufficient.
