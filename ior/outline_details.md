# Introduction 

## Tlon and Trump

### Comparison
* Two parallel stories of a fantasy world overthrowing reality
* The fictitious world of Tlon, existing in the literature of the nonexistent Uqbar
* The figure of Donald Trump as portrayed in tabloids and reality TV

### Counterarguments: resisting the comparison
* Definition of reality seems to proscribe this formulation.
  * That which is unaffected by fabrications.
  * Cannot be ignored.
  * If it could simply be ignored or altered by inventions, it would not really be "reality"
  * Introduce correction narrative here?
* In Borges, it is two fictional worlds.
  * The initial realistic world vs the final fantastical world.
  * The question of plausibility depends on which logic dominates.
  * By realistic logic the events are not plausible. By fantasy logic they are.
  * When the fantasy world wins, so does its logic.

### Problems with the correction narrative
* Reality will reassert itself.
* Applies if 

### First distinction
* A closer look reveals this is not in conflict with what happened in either case 
* In the case of Trump, it is not reality, but our understanding of it that is contested
  * The texts of non-fiction that contain the record of the episteme 
  * The institutions that produce and maintain this record
  * A conflict of readerships

### Borgesian joke
* In the case of Tlon, we do well to remember that the original world is not the real world, but merely realistic
  * It corresponds to the texts of non-fiction, but is not bound by any higher laws
  * So as the two worlds diverge we see one fictional world overtake the other.
* The crux of the joke:
  * the belief system of Tlon is one that prioritizes ideality over empirical evidence
  * Thus, from the perspective of Tlon, they have the stronger claim
  * Since both worlds are fiction, they have a point!
  * But the root of the joke goes deep into the heart of western philosophy, in which Borges was well-versed
  * He choses Berkeley's idealism, but without a deity to gaurantee consistency across different subjective experiences of the world. 
  * The idea is to answer the question "What if we were to imagine a society that, unlike Hume, found Berkeley's arguments compelling"
  * This last piece of the fiction escapes the fictional world, and crosses the boundary into the philosophy of the west

### Return to Trump
* The increasing divergence of readerships
* Not just a matter of ignorance, as both sides prefer to claim.
* It would be comforting to think so.
* Nor is it exactly a problem of creeping "politicization"
* Rather, a recognition even on a subconscious level of the role of politics, aesthetics, desires in the construction of the episteme

## Epistemology and Metaphysics

### Historical context
* Philosophy has worked relentlessly to head off this crisis, but without success 
* It has been a long time in the making---perhaps from the very beginning
* Certainly visible at least by the crisis of authority that toppled sovereignty

### The episteme
  * An interior model of the world. An idea of the world.
  * The total of knowledge as distinguished from falsehood or mere belief
  * the sum total of true statements about reality
  * For a certain definition of truth, it should be just as unshakeable as reality itself.
  * That is, if it really consists of things we know for certain to be true, there is no way to threaten it.
  * Any additional truth with be consistent with what we know already.
  * Any falsehood will be excluded.
  * This was its ambition 

### The problems of epistemology
* Can only give a very brief and rough treatment of this topic here.
* What is the criteria for inclusion in the episteme?
  * "Evidence based"
    * The method of science.
    * Problem: requires something of a lowered standard of truth
    * We have only what we do not yet know to be false.
    * Knowledge here is not certain, but contingent, always subject to later revision.
  * "Formal / a priori" reasoning
    * Hume's "matters of fact"
    * Russell's "idealism" in geometry
    * Based on the idea that there must be at least some kernel of propositions we can establish as true, or at least agree are obvious.
    * Strategy is to set down:
      * founding assumptions
      * the allowable rules for producing new true statements based on known true statements (logic)
    * then attempt to build out a network which would contain correct statements about the world.
    * Note that initial assumptions and rules of logic are usually separated but I would argue that the rules of logic itself are part of the founding assumptions
    * The result should be a faithful mirror of the noumenal world. 
 
### Metaphysics
* The name of this foundational kernel
* The anchor / point of connection back to noumenal world

#### Importance
* Everything follows from these initial conditions.
* Reduces the problem of defending every claim to defending just the metaphysics.

#### Difficulties
* Difficult to justify these initial choices on philosophical grounds (since philosophy follows from them).
* Therefore, hard to defend against an attack on the metaphysics.
* A different choice of metaphysics will produce a critique.

## The structural critique of philosophy
* When we apply a structural analysis to the episteme, a strange "event" occurs
* The role of the founding concept as a "center" in the structure, or a ground 

### The problem of the center
* Unsatisfiable requirements: must be inside and outside the system

* History of metaphysics as substitutions of center for center

### Return to Tlon
* What kind of society would have a motive to adopt or would be served by supporting a secular idealism?
* The imaginary world of Tlon is Borges's answer
* What the narrative hints at in the various paradoxes and philosophical arguments invented is that the difference between these two massively divergent, irreconcilable points of view, is merely one of expedience, desire, erotics, and aesthetics.

## Implications:

### Not discarding metaphysics, or moving beyond it:
* Identifying this problem does not mean throwing everything out and starting over.
* Indeed, this is exactly the metaphysical gesture (see more below). This is how we got here.
* Does not mean "nihilism"
* Or "there is no meaning"
* We are not saying that our interior model is unrelated to the world, only that the relation is one of belief rather than certainty.
  * It is no more secure than empirical sciences.

### But rather:
* reconceiving the episteme
* Not a mirror, or a rooted tree, but more like an expanding network, large, unanchored, thoroughly subjective
* The possibility of multiple such galaxies, growing to fill different aesthetics and desires
  * The desire to avoid pain is only one among many 
  * Are these Kuhn's paradigms?
* reconceiving the sign (speech / writing)
  * No longer the signifier of the signified, but the signifier of the signifier
  * Before, there were two kinds of signs:
    * The logos, which had one side facing to the true thing
    * And the gram connecting one representation to another.
    * With the logos, then everything connected to it is part of the logos.
  * Thus the logos gives way to the gram
  * We see the logos as a special kind of writing 

#### Logos revisited
* System of hearing oneself speak
* Liveness, presence
* Freedom: a causal origin
* The possibility of independence, because of coming first. Being the first point. The point of departure.

#### Gram revisited
* Technique, artifice, distance, delay, death
* Determination: what is already fixed, not just because it is set down, but because it is determined by a predecessor
* A universe with no rupture

# Strategy, aesthetics, authority

## Strategies of the logos
* Forgery of the origin
  * Produce a center and then erase or obfuscate its history
* Disciplinary boundaries: delimit the domain of thought and relegate the origin to another domain
  * This can be done mutually from discipline to discipline to form a descending chain
 
* The aesthetic of realism.
* Return to Trump and Borges.
* Donald Trump pretending to be someone else talking about Donald Trump.
