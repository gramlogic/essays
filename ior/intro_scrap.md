## stakes
* Our system for designating authority depends largely on this record of what happened. 
* It is absolutely possible to take over the world by changing what people believe to be true about it.

## non-fiction vs reality
* Perhaps an objective world remains indifferent, but no one knows about it, and the fictional world succeeds in attaining the authority of non-fiction.
* This position might be tenable if the conflict in question truly was one between fiction and reality itself. 
* As in the Borges story, however, to frame the conflict this way is to adopt the perspective of someone who has already accepted one system of texts as the true representative of reality.
  * To succumb to this temptation is to misconstrue conflict. 
  * This is to make a mistake about what is in conflict. 
* is only by speaking from the perspective of the readership and believers of one of these systems that allows the conflict to be framed as fiction vs. reality.
* Of course, this framing operates regardless of which system of texts one accords the status of non-fiction. Thus, both sides agree on this framing, and disagree only about which is which.
* conflict between a fictional world and the real world, but a conflict between two systems of text, _both_ of which claim to be nonfiction.
* Both promote their own narrative of reckoning.
* Here we should note that a conflict between fiction and non-fiction is slightly different from a conflict between fiction and reality itself.
* Again, it is only those speaking from the perspective of the readership and believers of the publications that have traditionally been accorded the status of non-fiction---admittedly, a sympathetic view---who describe the conflict 
* One fictional world can overthrow another, but a fictional world cannot overthrow a non-fictional one---and this is the primary law of the non-fictional world. If it were to be violated we would discover, like Borges's protagonists, that the governing principles of the world do not distinguish between fiction and non-fiction.


## Language, subjectivity
* Authority is something that is judged from the perspective of a subject.
* When we talk about texts we are talking about language.
* might claim: not under the jurisdiction of a human arbitrator, but is measured instead by their relationship to actual events and phenomena. But without some proof or consequences there is no "correction."

The texts of non-fiction have a special relation to real events and facts and cannot be adulterated. Note that this relies on reckoning--this is the key that distinguishes between the two stories. The anything possible of fiction and the anchored texts of non-fiction.
 
So the conflict really is not between reality and fiction, but between fiction and non-fiction. Two systems of texts. And both claim to be true. Like the Borges story, it is not the real world that is invaded, but one system of texts that takes over another. 

If we skip reckoning, reality maybe doesn't care, but also fiction can do anything. 

It is good to remember that the fantasy of course has very serious consequences any time it becomes the basis for decisions and behavior. Moreover, "failure" here might entail being proven wrong in a way that has catastrophic consequences for believers and non-believers alike. So this is not tremendously comforting, even if you believe it.

So the correction narrative turns out to be the key that distinguishes between these two stories. Therefore, we should look at what it really claims. Key to understanding it is to say what "failure" means.


Of course, there is only one story. Tlon exists as part of the "outer" fictional world. What the success of Tlon reveals is simply that our initial expectations about this outer world were incorrect. We begin with the impression that we are witnessing a realistic world, but in such a world Tlon could not have won. Rather, increasingly as the story progresses we get to a state of events  

As the events of the story cause the realistic world to lose influence to the fantastical world, the story of their conflict also shifts its character.

* Phases of the story: realistic to fantastical.
* A single story: what kind of story is it?

 This sets up a very careful inflection point: the question of whether the story is plausible depends on whether it is evaluated from the perspective of the initial, realistic, world or the final, fantastical one. By the logic of realistic narrative, it is implausible that a fantasy world could take over reality. By the logic of a fantasy narrative, it is plausible. As the fantasy world achieves its conquest, the fantasy logic rises to dominance.

The observation that both worlds are fictional represents a breakdown of the authority of the realistic world, which asserts itself as the more serious one.

Talk about "reality" vs Trump universe. It is an oversimplification. Elements of Trump's world are obviously as real as the life of any individual.

And of course even fantasies are part of the real world.

What happens in the story gives us a better model: certain aspects of the world have risen to prominence

[Return later to an examination of these two logics.]

"In the real world"

If Trump's fiction is up against the real world, on the other hand, the implicit logic that makes it possible to conceive of such a world also suggests we should expect some kind of "correction" since reality is a thing that cannot be denied or ignored without penalty.
