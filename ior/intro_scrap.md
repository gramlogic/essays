## stakes
* If we skip reckoning, reality maybe doesn't care, but also fiction can do anything. 
* It is good to remember that the fantasy of course has very serious consequences any time it becomes the basis for decisions and behavior. Moreover, "failure" here might entail being proven wrong in a way that has catastrophic consequences for believers and non-believers alike. So this is not tremendously comforting, even if you believe it.
* Our system for designating authority depends largely on this record of what happened. 
* It is absolutely possible to take over the world by changing what people believe to be true about it.

## non-fiction, reality, reckoning
* If Trump's fiction is up against the real world, on the other hand, the implicit logic that makes it possible to conceive of such a world also suggests we should expect some kind of "correction" since reality is a thing that cannot be denied or ignored without penalty.
* Perhaps an objective world remains indifferent, but no one knows about it, and the fictional world succeeds in attaining the authority of non-fiction.
* This position might be tenable if the conflict in question truly was one between fiction and reality itself. 
* As in the Borges story, however, to frame the conflict this way is to adopt the perspective of someone who has already accepted one system of texts as the true representative of reality.
  * To succumb to this temptation is to misconstrue conflict. 
  * This is to make a mistake about what is in conflict. 
* is only by speaking from the perspective of the readership and believers of one of these systems that allows the conflict to be framed as fiction vs. reality.
* Of course, this framing operates regardless of which system of texts one accords the status of non-fiction. Thus, both sides agree on this framing, and disagree only about which is which.
* conflict between a fictional world and the real world, but a conflict between two systems of text, _both_ of which claim to be nonfiction.
* Both promote their own narrative of reckoning.
* Here we should note that a conflict between fiction and non-fiction is slightly different from a conflict between fiction and reality itself.
* Again, it is only those speaking from the perspective of the readership and believers of the publications that have traditionally been accorded the status of non-fiction---admittedly, a sympathetic view---who describe the conflict 
* One fictional world can overthrow another, but a fictional world cannot overthrow a non-fictional one---and this is the primary law of the non-fictional world. If it were to be violated we would discover, like Borges's protagonists, that the governing principles of the world do not distinguish between fiction and non-fiction.
* The texts of non-fiction have a special relation to real events and facts and cannot be adulterated. Note that this relies on reckoning--this is the key that distinguishes between the two stories. The anything possible of fiction and the anchored texts of non-fiction.
* So the conflict really is not between reality and fiction, but between fiction and non-fiction. Two systems of texts. And both claim to be true. Like the Borges story, it is not the real world that is invaded, but one system of texts that takes over another. 
* And of course even fantasies are part of the real world.

## Language, subjectivity
* Authority is something that is judged from the perspective of a subject.
* When we talk about texts we are talking about language.
* might claim: not under the jurisdiction of a human arbitrator, but is measured instead by their relationship to actual events and phenomena. But without some proof or consequences there is no "correction."

So the correction narrative turns out to be the key that distinguishes between these two stories. Therefore, we should look at what it really claims. Key to understanding it is to say what "failure" means.

Of course, there is only one story. Tlon exists as part of the "outer" fictional world. What the success of Tlon reveals is simply that our initial expectations about this outer world were incorrect. We begin with the impression that we are witnessing a realistic world, but in such a world Tlon could not have won. Rather, increasingly as the story progresses we get to a state of events  

## Tlon's progress
As the events of the story cause the realistic world to lose influence to the fantastical world, the story of their conflict also shifts its character.
* Phases of the story: realistic to fantastical.
* A single story: what kind of story is it?
* This sets up a very careful inflection point: the question of whether the story is plausible depends on whether it is evaluated from the perspective of the initial, realistic, world or the final, fantastical one. By the logic of realistic narrative, it is implausible that a fantasy world could take over reality. By the logic of a fantasy narrative, it is plausible. As the fantasy world achieves its conquest, the fantasy logic rises to dominance.
* The observation that both worlds are fictional represents a breakdown of the authority of the realistic world, which asserts itself as the more serious one.
* What happens in this story gives us a better model for understanding what is happening with Trump: certain aspects of the world have risen to prominence
* Return later to an examination of the two logics of Tlon.

## Compact intro
Jorge Luis Borges's Tlon, Uqbar Orbis Tertius, tells the story of protagonists who discover, through an apocryphal article in a counterfeit encyclopedia, a vast imaginary world that eventually invades and subsumes their own reality. The biography of Donald Trump is a modern remake of this tale. He is a figure who rose out of supermarket tabloids to achieve prominence in the universe of reality television, then turned the forces of this self-aggrandizing fantasy against reality itself, and with considerable success.

At least, that is how it seemed to many adherents of the old regime: the readership of the news articles and reportage, scientific studies, academic papers, polls, election results, statutes, rulings and other documents that consitute the inter-connected texts of non-fiction, the collection of genres that endeavored to represent the real world. From the perspective of those who accept these texts as authorative, it appears that reality itself is under attack, and the mutiny against it is all the more outrageous on account of the fact that the word "reality" denotes exactly that which should be both invulnerable and indifferent to the content of personal fantasies or delusions, regardless of the number of adherents. That is, if it means anything, "reality" should describe that which is beyond the reach of language, unaffected by our representations of it. It seems that anyone who simply adopts a more convenient set of "alternate facts" is destined for comeuppance sooner or later.

And already this narrative has found an audience: the pandemic and eventually the election could not be pretended away. And yet, the effort to do so---the decision to take action based on these alternate facts---surely become part of the real world. And more troubling, one must re-evaluate the confidence that reality, whatever it might ultimately be---will eventually reassert itself. This is especially true in the case of events like a pandemic that are too large for any individual to directly experience. It is also true for events like global warming, which are both too large and too slow. Reality has no obligation to "assert itself"; people make assertions about it. 

What we have instead is a system in which people, often gathered into institutions, make assertions about reality. Whether these assertions are or are not correct is a difficult question. These assertions form a kind of interconnected text. The text is disseminated to a readership, the members of which may add their own personal experience, or may decide not to. This system, unlike the exterior universe it purports to represent, is not self-maintaining. It requires defense.

---
Within the bounds of fiction, this reversal is allowed because there is no requirement for a reckoning against independent phenomena that comprise the objects and events the text describes. 

## Come Back
In fiction, a fictional world can conquer reality. In reality, it cannot.

## cache
The idea of a reckoning is required to tip the scale in favor of one of these systems or another.

is only broken by the promise of a reckoning, which will tip the scale in favor of one text or the other. 

without reckoning, we have symmetry
still not fantasy vs reality but two conflicting systems of texts that claim the status of non-fiction

The firm line between fantasy and reality is supposed to prevent such an outcome. This seems comforting, but what is troubling is that Trump could have invoked exactly the same explanation to explain his win. In fact, any outcome can be described after the fact as the inevitable consequences of the real world. The reason is that we only know this world by its consequences. The lion from its claw.  
it can always be applied after the fact to claim 

So far this has not happened, but that does not guarantee it could not. And we should be suspicious of any assurances to the contrary.

For one thing it's reversible.

While it seems that only the promise of a reckoning preserves the separation between fact and fiction, at the same time there is no guarantee.
---later

You have to have a desire.

and this allows us to persist in the belief that it cannot happen.
Any outcome can be described as the inevitable consequences of any theory that predicted that outcome. 

The problems:
* failure to contradict a hypothesis does not prove it
* If Trump had won he would have described his victory in the same way.
* We only construct an idea of the world retroactively by extrapolating from what we observe. (lion from claw)
* What is on the line is not just events, but the status of fiction.


It would be comforting to draw such a conclusion, but it is troubling that exactly the same explanation would be applied to explain Trump's win.
 To view his defeat as evidence of a reckoning 

It would prove that it is all just propaganda designed to serve individual goals.

In the face of Trump's defeat, then, one could see it as evidence of the opposite conclusion: 



This distinction follows directly from the definitions of the words.


 Perhaps foremost that he is a genius rather than a fool.
can Trump do this?

yes and no

more than you'd think

In the reckoning narrative, Trump's failure is predictable.


To summarize, then:  If one could conjure a pandemic away simply by pretending it didn't exist, 

Examples: you cannot conjure a pandemic out of existence

More precisely, one cannot make a thing true by sheer force of will.

* Since we are not the protagonists in a story
* Trump's strategy was always doomed.
If this were not the case we would learn that we are not 

Whereas a fictional text is not constrained by the requirement to represent and be measured against the objects and events it describes, the texts of non-fiction are beholden to an external measure by which true statements are distinguished from fabrications. Thus the reckoning narrative implies that Trump's loss of the election is part of evidence that his strategy was fundamentally unsustainable. His opponent was not simply a group of political rivals, but a universe of factual information that could not simply be pretended away. Perhaps nothing embodied this reality like the pandemic. Thus, the narrative suggests that the self-serving fantasy of Donald Trump was always doomed, at least eventually, to fail. This moment of reckoning is what distinguishes between Trump's story and the story of Tlon. It establishes the boundary between fiction and non-fiction: one fictional world can conquer another, but a fictional world cannot permanently invade or replace a system of non-fictional texts without consequence.
