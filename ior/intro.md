# Fake News, Reality TV: The Signature of Donald Trump
```{quote}
Hume noted for all time that Berkeley's arguments did not admit the slightest refutation nor did they cause the slightest conviction.
```

## Tlon and Trump
* Two parallel stories of a fantasy world overthrowing reality
  * The fictitious world of Tlon, existing in the literature of the nonexistent Uqbar
  * The figure of Donald Trump as portrayed in tabloids and reality TV
  * Ousting all pretenders
* Appearance of reality under attack
  * Corresponding appearance that there is no need for action
  * Part of the narrative.
  * Part of the complacency that got us here.
* On closer inspection, not fantasy vs reality
* Borges anticipated this in his story: two fictions

### First distinction
* "reality" should be invulnerable to imaginary threats
* A closer look reveals this is not in conflict with what happened in either case 
* In the case of Trump, it is not reality, but our understanding of it that is contested
  * The texts of non-fiction that contain the record of the episteme 
  * The institutions that produce and maintain this record
  * A conflict of readerships

### Borgesian joke
* In the case of Tlon, we do well to remember that the original world is not the real world, but merely realistic
  * It corresponds to the texts of non-fiction, but is not bound by any higher laws
  * So as the two worlds diverge we see one fictional world overtake the other.
* The crux of the joke:
  * the belief system of Tlon is one that prioritizes ideality over empirical evidence
  * Thus, from the perspective of Tlon, they have the stronger claim
  * Since both worlds are fiction, they have a point!
  * But the root of the joke goes deep into the heart of western philosophy, in which Borges was well-versed
  * He choses Berkeley's idealism, but without a deity to gaurantee consistency across different subjective experiences of the world. 
  * The idea is to answer the question "What if we were to imagine a society that, unlike Hume, found Berkeley's arguments compelling"
  * This last piece of the fiction escapes the fictional world, and crosses the boundary into the philosophy of the west

### Return to Trump
* The increasing divergence of readerships
* Not just a matter of ignorance, as both sides prefer to claim.
* It would be comforting to think so.
* Nor is it exactly a problem of creeping "politicization"
* Rather, a recognition even on a subconscious level of the role of politics, aesthetics, desires in the construction of the episteme

### Goals 
* Continued relevance of the critique of metaphysics
* Integrate more of the lost ideas

## Tlon and Trump
In Jorge Luis Borges's short story Tlon, Uqbar Orbis Tertius, an apocryphal article in a bootleg encyclopedia provides the first announcement of the imaginary world of Tlon. As word spreads and interest grows, the stories, beliefs, customs and claims of this fictional world accumulate until they threaten wholly to replace the reality they have invaded. Unbelievable though it seems, the biography of Donald Trump is a remake of this tale: the story of a figure who rose out of supermarket tabloids to achieve prominence in the universe of reality television, then turned the forces of a self-promoting fantasy against reality itself, with considerable success. Trump worked relentlessly to build and disseminate an outlandish dreamworld in which he was king; once in power, he moved agressively to oust all other pretenders: the news articles and reportage, scientific studies, academic papers, tax returns, polls, election results, statutes, court rulings and other documents that challenged his account of the world and threatened his claim over it. 

To adherents of the old regime it appeared that reality itself was under attack---a mutiny made all the more outrageous on account of the fact that "reality" denotes exactly that which should be both invulnerable and indifferent to the content of personal delusions, regardless of their popularity---beyond the influence of influencers. If it means anything, that is, "reality" should describe that which is beyond the reach of fabrications, unaffected by our representations or misrepresentations of it. Neither should we be able to ignore it without consequence; anyone who simply adopts a more convenient set of "alternate facts" should be destined for comeuppance sooner or later. The implicit logic behind the idea of reality, that which cannot be denied or ignored without penalty, suggests we should expect some kind of "correction." And with Trump's universe now seemingly in retreat, this correction narrative seems poised to reassert itself.
 
In this respect, Trump's story should end differently from Borges's parable, in that the former occurs in the real world, whereas the latter is after all a work of fiction. It is only speaking from the perspective of the protagonists that one could say a fantasy world overthrew reality. The "reality" that is invaded by the fictional world of Tlon is itself already an impostor, albeit an initially realistic one in which names and places correspond with the historical record.[FIX] The story is therefore not about a fictional world that conquers the real world, but rather one fictional world that conquers another.

Or rather, it is a story of protagonists who discover the world they live in is not what they thought. It turns out, to their surprise, not to be a realistic universe, in which Tlon could not plausibly prevail. Instead, as the fantasy world achieves preeminence, the events of the plot become increasingly unrealistic--that is, implausible according to the logic and expectations of a realistic world. This leads to an inflection point, at which the story itself ceases to be controlled by realistic logic. By the logic of Tlon, of course, these events are eminently plausible. Thus as Tlon rises to power, so does its logic.

Of course, there is only one story. Tlon exists as part of the "outer" fictional world. What the success of Tlon reveals is simply that our initial expectations about this outer world were incorrect. We begin with the impression that we are witnessing a realistic world, but in such a world Tlon could not have won. Rather, increasingly as the story progresses we get to a state of events  

As the events of the story cause the realistic world to lose influence to the fantastical world, the story of their conflict also shifts its character.

* Phases of the story: realistic to fantastical.
* 
* A single story: what kind of story is it?

This view of the events of the story does not pose a challenge to the definition of the word reality. It does raise a question of 

 This sets up a very careful inflection point: the question of whether the story is plausible depends on whether it is evaluated from the perspective of the initial, realistic, world or the final, fantastical one. By the logic of realistic narrative, it is implausible that a fantasy world could take over reality. By the logic of a fantasy narrative, it is plausible. As the fantasy world achieves its conquest, the fantasy logic rises to dominance.

The observation that both worlds are fictional represents a breakdown of the authority of the realistic world, which asserts itself as the more serious one.

Of course, it is only as a provisional and convenient approximation that we divide the story into its realistic and unrealistic phases, both of which are intertwined together to form a single text. The fact that this is easy to forget this was surely not lost on Borges. He makes use of our expectations by setting us up to imagine the world in one way and then gradually introducing information that makes this initial conception impossible to sustain. Rather than a contest between two separate worlds, we have really a kind of power struggle over what ideas and representations are understood as authoritative.

Even this is not quite right, since the world of Tlon is part of the story.

* Binary: And of course, both the fantastic and realistic narratives are part of the same text, and it is only as a temporary and convenient approximation that we discuss a clear division between them.
* This contest of logics is a better way of thinking about what is happening.
* New paragraph: So it is also with respect to Donald Trump. Only as hyperbole or convenient approximation can we talk about separate universes.
* Just as the story of Tlon really exists, so does Donald Trump the man, and so does the National Enquirer and the Apprentice. What we have instead is a lot of texts struggling to establish a logic that supports them. This is not to imply equality, but the grounds for asserting superiority are complex. Much is based on aesthetics, and this is genuinely a contest of etiquette that can be fairly charged as elitist.



Talk about "reality" vs Trump universe. It is an oversimplification. Elements of Trump's world are obviously as real as the life of any individual.

And of course even fantasies are part of the real world.

What happens in the story gives us a better model: certain aspects of the world have risen to prominence

[Return later to an examination of these two logics.]

"In the real world"

If Trump's fiction is up against the real world, on the other hand, the implicit logic that makes it possible to conceive of such a world also suggests we should expect some kind of "correction" since reality is a thing that cannot be denied or ignored without penalty.

Thus, many maintained a faith that there would eventually and inevitably be some kind of "correction." And with Trump's universe now seemingly in retreat, this correction narrative seems poised to reassert itself. A narrative that claims things like infectious diseases can't be conjured away with inventive press releases, and the decision to collectively ignore them will be rebuffed by our collective elimination. Small comfort. Clearly it would be preferable not to wait for such an intervention. And the political advantage of the claim that reality itself will assure an outcome always carries a danger of encouraging inaction.

despite the obvious very real effects on the behavior and decisions of a large portion of the population,
this kind of reality oddly excludes the texts themselves, the really existing tabloid pages, and the real effects of the narratives they contain, like human beings refusing to get vaccinated, accept election results, react to global warming, etc. That is, it either excludes them or attempts to contain them all under the umbrella of what will eventually be corrected.

Yet, we should be skeptical of this narrative for other reasons. 
* First, there is no basis for imaging that reality is guaranteed to assert itself, but a great deal of evidence suggesting that human beings are capable of sustaining an uncorrobated fantasy for a very long time. It has even been put forward, with some merit, that delusion is inseparable from the concept of the human.
* Second, although we may believe that one set of ideas is more correct than another, it is outrageous to assert this without argument. To allow this is to allow it for any set of ideas. Morevover, until the argument is made, we are not dealing with truth against lies, but two networks of claims about the world.
  * Provisionally, then, what we have is not the true believers against the heretics, but one readership against another.

Borges's parable anticipates this already. A careful reader will note that it is not a story of fantasy against reality, but one fictional world against another. The first, the world in which the story begins, invokes the names and places of the non-fiction world, but it is a fiction nonetheless.

Similarly, in the case of Trump, we have a contest between fundamentally the same kinds of things. Whatever their differences, they are both still bodies of texts and claims. It is not an easy task to explain why one should be preferred over another, especially against self-interest. We should not underestimate this.

* Third, we cannot make the argument.
  * Along with this, we should be suspicious of the idea that the problem is one of education. At least if this is meant to indicate that more education allows one to more easily distinguish truth from falsity. The underlying problem is really one of aesthetics and motivations. An educational program intended to address this problem cannot stop at empirical claims; it must address the motivations of the actors producing these claims and the implications of the world view the claims support. In other words, we must describe the politics of our beliefs as part of the argument for accepting them.
  * More briefly, these conclusions call for a certain kind of educational program that is not restricted to discussion of allegedly neutral information. This is exactly the kind of program that departments of the humanities have been developing for at least some 50 years now, and which a hostile, Trumpist mob attempts to gather and attack under the blunt label of critical race theory.
  * It is good politics to pretend--or better, believe--that one is merely the neutral servant of a higher power, merely the messenger of a factual reality, neutrally reporting. That is, that the interests and desires that drive the behavior of the speaker play no role in determining what is spoken.
  * We will see that this political stance is at least as old as Plato. 

Borgesian joke--where does this go?
---
Not just because it seems to encourage complacency (this is always the danger of a propaganda strategy that claims the desired outcome is inevitable), or because it underestimates the threat, but because it fails totally to explain the basis on which we imagine that there is any such guarantee. On the contrary, there is neither evidence not reasoning to demonstrate that humanity on the whole is not capable of sustaining a state of permanent war with reality. It may be the case that the notion of the human is tied inextricably to such a war.  

But another problem is that reality is not on the battlefield.

* And already this narrative has found its own sizable audience: 
* The problem with this narrative is that it also supports a kind of complacency that Trump exploited
  * an underestimating of the fantastic or the ridiculous. 
  * An underestimation of language.
* Small comfort. They could take us all with them.
* But worse, it really is unclear on what basis we imagine that there would be such a guarantee.
* Along with this, we should be suspicious of the idea that the problem is one of education.
* What we have is not the true believers against the heretics, but one readership against another.

The Borgesian joke: prefer Berkeley's world.

---
Jorge Luis Borges's Tlon, Uqbar Orbis Tertius, tells the story of protagonists who discover, through an apocryphal article in a counterfeit encyclopedia, a vast imaginary world that eventually invades and subsumes their own reality. The biography of Donald Trump is a modern remake of this tale. He is a figure who rose out of supermarket tabloids to achieve prominence in the universe of reality television, then turned the forces of this self-aggrandizing fantasy against reality itself, and with considerable success.

At least, that is how it seemed to many adherents of the old regime: the readership of the news articles and reportage, scientific studies, academic papers, polls, election results, statutes, rulings and other documents that consitute the inter-connected texts of non-fiction, the collection of genres that endeavored to represent the real world. From the perspective of those who accept these texts as authorative, it appears that reality itself is under attack, and the mutiny against it is all the more outrageous on account of the fact that the word "reality" denotes exactly that which should be both invulnerable and indifferent to the content of personal fantasies or delusions, regardless of the number of adherents. That is, if it means anything, "reality" should describe that which is beyond the reach of language, unaffected by our representations of it. It seems that anyone who simply adopts a more convenient set of "alternate facts" is destined for comeuppance sooner or later.

And already this narrative has found an audience: the pandemic and eventually the election could not be pretended away. And yet, the effort to do so---the decision to take action based on these alternate facts---surely become part of the real world. And more troubling, one must re-evaluate the confidence that reality, whatever it might ultimately be---will eventually reassert itself. This is especially true in the case of events like a pandemic that are too large for any individual to directly experience. It is also true for events like global warming, which are both too large and too slow. Reality has no obligation to "assert itself"; people make assertions about it. 

What we have instead is a system in which people, often gathered into institutions, make assertions about reality. Whether these assertions are or are not correct is a difficult question. These assertions form a kind of interconnected text. The text is disseminated to a readership, the members of which may add their own personal experience, or may decide not to. This system, unlike the exterior universe it purports to represent, is not self-maintaining. It requires defense.

Closer inspection reveals this is not the conflict that too


* We have to acknowledge that these representations are important.
* What is being defended is not reality itself, but its textual surrogate.
* This surrogate is not self-maintaining. It requires defense.
* We know that the world can be conquered this way because that's how we built it in the first place.

* one readership against another

* Not fantasy and reality, but two systems of text that are both very much part of the physical world, and have the ability to affect the bodies that move in this world.

The protagonists of Tlon:
* Begin in a realistic universe (in which places and names correspond to those of reality), which is to say they match non-fiction texts.
* Increasingly diverge.
* But remember both worlds are a fiction. Simply one fictional world taking over another. 

The Borgesian joke:
* Berkeley's idealism without Berkeley's God.
* The status of what is real is exactly what is in question. Borges creates a situation in which the fantasy world subscribes to a metaphysics that allows it to see itself as more real and more legitimate than the world it is replacing.
* As if to answer the question, "what if there were a planet of people who found Berkeley's arguments convincing"?
* A joke, but a serious joke. A joke with serious implications.
* Rooted in a critique of metaphysics that pits idealism against empiricism. 
* The point is that at a very deep level the arbitrator is not reason but desire.

How did Trump do it?
He is a figure who rose out of supermarket tabloids to achieve prominence in the universe of reality television.
These outlets have in common that he was able to control what they said about him and the world.
He could pay to kill unfavorable stories, and he could write the narrative to portray an image of himself that he considered desirable.

Relation to metaphysics
* The goal has always been to prevent this from happening.
* The securing of the foundations is necessary for the distinction between knowledge and belief.
* It doesn't work.



Before one can move beyond shock and denial and begin to formulate a response, we must first understand what is contested.

Admit that it requires defense. 

based on how it is represented in language. This is not to minimize the threat, but rather to be a little more accurate about the battleground, which is not "reality itself" but its textual surrogate, the media in which it is represented, the mechanisms and institutions by which these representations are generated and authorized, the sanctioned procedures for registering disputes and resolving conflict in this representation.

Without this note, it is difficult to move beyond a state of shock and denial. Too easy to underestimate the real danger of the Trump-led attack. Too easy to misunderstand the way that language and representation are themselves a real part of the world they mediate, and have the consequences of physical forces and suffering. What _appeared_ as a conflict between reality in fantasy is better modeled as a conflict between two audiences who attributed final authority to different sets of texts.  

TLON and the serious JOKE:

In Borges's story the invaders have a point: the entire action takes place within fiction. What looks like fiction overtaking reality is actually one fictional universe replacing another, albeit more "realistic" one.

More accurately, one readership pitted against another.

then led this fictional universe and its devoted audience in an massive assault against a system of nonfictional texts believed by many to be out of bounds:

The only thing new about this is the scale of the assault and the speed with which it achieved or nearly achieved many of its goals. It neither began with Donald Trump nor ended with his presidency. The current furor over "critical race theory" represents the latest front in this war.

Borges's joke hinges on the fact that the value system of the imaginary world of Tlon was one in which ideal existence is prioritized over empirical evidence---a parody of Berkeley's idealism, with the modification that it is not grounded by the omniscient gaze of Berkeley's God. 

The joke is that the imaginary world employs a standard of evidence that causes it to consider itself more real than the world it is displacing. From the perspective of the protagonists, who seem to live in our world (at least in the beginning), the world of Tlon is a fiction because it cannot be empirically experienced.

The key is Hume's critique of Berkeley. What if there was a person who found Berkeley's view _preferable_.

The problem is that the foundations of knowledge, the first assumptions, cannot be established through reasoning. They must be asserted by force. And the powers that determine this force are the desires or aesthetics that precede reason. Powers that emerge out of the psyche. Which in turn is produced by some kind of purely mechanical process that we might today characterize as a kind of ancient writing---writing that took place before there was a notion of language or letters.

A figure of the text that took advantage of the pliability of certain disreputable sources of information.

Trump generated a whole reality that attempted in earnest to swallow this world.

The reason we know this to be a threat is that it has happened before. This vulnerability has already been exploited. It is not a new threat, but the repetition of a strategy that has worked well in the past.

Strategies for attaining authority.

Strike at the root.
The Viceroy, or forging the origin. Erase the author.
Critical mass.

"sticks and stones"
The irony that it is exactly the importance of language that is being denied as a strategy to elevate the effectiveness of language in installing propaganda. This is part of a more general technique for establishing authority, in which one erases the source of the message.

## What keeps the president safe

## The idea of reality

The system of hearing oneself speak, which creates the idea of the self and also in some sense gives rise to the idea of the world. That which is not self. What is beyond the system.

And what can we say about it. This problem that the idea of reality really is an idea, even if it is thought to be a thing from which all ideas emerge.

## The idea of reality
The problem is that reality, no matter who complains, is an idea. It may be an idea of a thing that produces the creature that perceives it as an idea. But it at the same time can never escape its ideality.

Say again: I have a thought of the world, and the world I imagine is one that precedes and encompasses me, though I am the one who thinks it.


The problem of epistemological foundations.

How do we know what we know. It goes all the way back to this system.

This moment of erasing the system that produces the voice. A more primordial writing.


## Goal
The point of this paper is to explain the continued relevance of the poststructural critique of metaphysics in understanding the current intellectual and political moment. For a variety of reasons, the flurry of new ideas that came into and profoundly affectly the humanities in the late 20th century have not been fully processed. They continue to give the impression of disconnected phenomenon. I believe this is an effect of the unfolding process of knowledge production in the humanities. Any particular theory can only have a limited amount of time before it no longer captures the academic imagination, and thus no longer can be the name of the study. Moreover, the theory was difficult to understand and overwhelming in its implications. So what has happened is that the portions with the most obvious material applications were spun off into new studies, integrated into standpoint theory, or decolonial studies. 

But in some cases, old problems continue to trouble us. We see again and again the reinscription of the logocentric gesture. We are perplexed by phenomena that we have a theory to describe. 

two main factors: first, a series of quick insights overwhelmed the academic world, second the academic world is beholden to certain structural constraints. These are usually described in terms of disciplinarity but they also exert their influence in a temporal dimension by limiting the amount of time and energy that can be spent on any one theory. Some of this is an unfortunate manifestation of "funding structure" but some, surely, represents a more general tendency to lose interest in the familiar. The trick of reinvigorating the familiar world, breaking the hypnosis of the ordinary, is the purview of the artist. As is the converse trick: bringing the ordinary into being in the first place. We are caught in the contest of these castings.

In other words, there is a relentless need in academia to push forward to new ideas and coin new
