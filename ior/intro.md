# Fake News, Reality TV: The Signature of Donald Trump
```{quote}
Hume noted for all time that Berkeley's arguments did not admit the slightest refutation nor did they cause the slightest conviction.
```

## Tlon and Trump
* Two parallel stories of a fantasy world overthrowing reality
  * The fictitious world of Tlon, existing in the literature of the nonexistent Uqbar
  * The figure of Donald Trump as portrayed in tabloids and reality TV
  * Ousting all pretenders
* Appearance of reality under attack
  * Corresponding appearance that there is no need for action
  * Part of the narrative.
  * Part of the complacency that got us here.
* On closer inspection, not fantasy vs reality
* Borges anticipated this in his story: two fictions

### First distinction
* "reality" should be invulnerable to imaginary threats
* A closer look reveals this is not in conflict with what happened in either case 
* In the case of Trump, it is not reality, but our understanding of it that is contested
  * The texts of non-fiction that contain the record of the episteme 
  * The institutions that produce and maintain this record
  * A conflict of readerships

### Borgesian joke
* In the case of Tlon, we do well to remember that the original world is not the real world, but merely realistic
  * It corresponds to the texts of non-fiction, but is not bound by any higher laws
  * So as the two worlds diverge we see one fictional world overtake the other.
* The crux of the joke:
  * the belief system of Tlon is one that prioritizes ideality over empirical evidence
  * Thus, from the perspective of Tlon, they have the stronger claim
  * Since both worlds are fiction, they have a point!
* The arabesque (may need to come later):
  * But the root of the joke goes deep into the heart of western philosophy, in which Borges was well-versed
  * He choses Berkeley's idealism, but without a deity to gaurantee consistency across different subjective experiences of the world. 
  * The idea is to answer the question "What if we were to imagine a society that, unlike Hume, found Berkeley's arguments compelling"
  * This last piece of the fiction escapes the fictional world, and crosses the boundary into the philosophy of the west

### Return to Trump
* The increasing divergence of readerships
* Not just a matter of ignorance, as both sides prefer to claim.
* It would be comforting to think so.
* Nor is it exactly a problem of creeping "politicization"
* Rather, a recognition even on a subconscious level of the role of politics, aesthetics, desires in the construction of the episteme

### Goals 
* Continued relevance of the critique of metaphysics
* Integrate more of the lost ideas

## Tlon, Trump, Reckoning
In Jorge Luis Borges's short story Tlon, Uqbar Orbis Tertius, an apocryphal article in a bootleg encyclopedia delivers the first announcement of existence of the imaginary world of Tlon. As word of the discovery spreads and interest grows, the stories, beliefs, customs and claims of this fictional world accumulate until they threaten wholly to replace the reality they have invaded. It is an impossible, wryly humorous story of an imaginary world that conquers a real one. 

One might read the biography of Donald Trump as a retelling of this tale: the story of a figure who rose out of supermarket tabloids to achieve prominence in the universe of reality television, then turned the forces of his self-promoting fantasy against reality itself, with considerable success. Trump worked relentlessly to build and disseminate an outlandish dreamworld in which he ruled supreme; once in power, he moved agressively to oust all other pretenders: the news articles and reportage, scientific studies, academic papers, tax returns, polls, election results, statutes, court rulings and other documents that challenged his account of the world and threatened his claim over it. 

Of course, there is an element of hyperbole in this analogy. I would not insist that Donald Trump, or, "realDonaldTrump" as he referred to himself, is a figment of pure fiction. Although I have never met him, I concede that he has a historical and physical existence. Yet I think it is fair to say that a hallmark first of his business strategy, then his political campaign was the brazenness with which he generated and then wielded against his opponents an extraordinary multitude of claims and interconnected narratives that were unmoored from and unabashedly in conflict with previously unchallenged records and reportage of non-fiction. A network of fabricated claims and narratives is a fictional world---an alternate version of reality. Trump's ability to achieve personal and political goals relied largely on his ability to develop a personally advantageous version of reality and install it as the authoritative record. It is as if the story of Tlon were weaponized for political gain.

To adherents of the old regime, the Trump administration's strategy appeared to be an attack on reality itself---a mutiny made all the more outrageous on account of the fact that "reality" denotes exactly that which should be both invulnerable and indifferent to the content of personal delusions, regardless of their popularity---beyond the influence of influencers. If it means anything, that is, "reality" should describe that which is outside the reach of fabrications, unaffected by our representations or misrepresentations of it. Neither should we be able to ignore it without consequence: anyone who responds to inconvenient truths by simply adopting a more convenient set of "alternate facts" should be destined for comeuppance sooner or later. The implicit logic behind the idea of reality, the idea of things that cannot be denied or ignored without penalty, suggests we should expect some kind of reckoning. And with Trump's universe now seemingly in retreat, this narrative of a reckoning seems poised to reassert itself.
 
This narrative relies in part on the belief that Trump's story is fundamentally different from Borges's parable, in that the former occurs in the real world, whereas the latter is after all a work of fiction. It is only speaking from the perspective of Borges's protagonists that one could say his story is about a fantasy world that overthrows reality. The "reality" that is invaded by the fictional world of Tlon is itself already an impostor, albeit an initially realistic one in which we see familiar names and places that correspond with the historical record, and the anecdotal style mimics a non-fictional account. In a more careful analysis we must admit that the story is not an account of a fictional world that conquers the real world, but rather of one fictional world that conquers another. 

Or rather, it is a story of protagonists who discover the world they live in is not what it seemed. It turns out, to their initial surprise but eventual resignation, not to be a "realistic" universe, in which the Tlonian invasion could not plausibly prevail. Instead, as Tlon achieves preeminence, the events of the plot become increasingly unrealistic--that is, implausible according to the logic and expectations derived from the laws of the real world. According to the beliefs of the people of Tlon, of course, the same events are eminently plausible, predictable, even "realistic" if this word can be used to indicate affinity to an alternate reality of reference. Thus the narrative arrives at an inflection point, at which it passes over into a series of events best explained on Tlonian terms. As Tlon rises to power, its success against the initial world validates and installs the novel logic it brings with it.

If Trump had succeeded in his bid to overturn the election, or if he were to suceed in establishing his preferred version of events---rewriting the historical narrative to include the birther, deep state, and QAnon conspiracies, as well as the more diffuse an unspecified conspiratorial thinking surrounding the behavior of academic instutitions, scientists and medical professionals that underly his pandemic and climate change denials---there can hardly be a question that he would claim his success validates his approach. Again, not without some justification. From the perspective of Trump's supporters, his success would corrobate the belief that there indeed were massive conspiracies to intentionally produce and disseminate false information. From the perspective of slightly more cynical supporters, perhaps Trump himself, it would validate the world view that there is ultimately no unbending backbone of reality behind our accounts---that every narrative is crafted according to an advertising logic, driven purely by the ulterior motives of the narrator, and that Trump's claims differ from others only with respect to whom those motives serve. In other words, there is no firm distinction between fiction and non-fiction, no moment of reckoning worth concerning oneself about. Even his opponents might draw a similar conclusion, having discovered, like Borges's protagonists, that their world was not as sturdy as it seemed. That is was vulnerable to an unexpected kind of attack. In this scenario, Trump's story would not be fundamentally different from Borges's tale after all.

Because Trump did not succeed, we can still sustain the belief that he was held back by the firm line between fantasy and reality, which is supposed to prevent such an outcome. This is the central tenet of the reckoning narrative: in a fantasy, a fantasy world can replace reality; in reality, it cannot. Thus the reckoning narrative understands Trump's loss of the election as simply the worldly manifestation of a failure that was always eventually guaranteed to befall a campaign whose strategy was fundamentally unsustainable. Trump's opponent was not simply a group of political rivals, but a universe of factual information that could not simply be pretended away. Comforting though this claim might seem, the mere failure to disprove it does not demonstrate that it is true, and we should be suspicious of any assurances to the contrary. For one thing, it troubles confidence to recognize that this explanation could be invoked from either side of our own inflection point: had Trump won, he could have claimed with equal justification that reality had triumphed over fantasy, even though the sets of claims referred to by the words reality and fantasy would be reversed.

This concerning symmetry is easier to understand if we clarify the distinction between "reality" and "non-fiction," i.e. between the world itself and what we collectively know or believe we know to be true about it. This distinction requires only that we concede that even a true statement of fact is something different from the fact itself that it asserts. We have on one hand a set of statements that considered to be true, what I have been calling non-fiction, but could also be called "knowledge," "facts" or "truth." Then on the other hand, there is the reality these statements describe. While it difficult to give a coherent account of a confrontation between what is real and what is not (how could such an event _occur_?), we should have little trouble imagining a contest between two conflicting systems of texts that both claim the status of non-fiction.    
* Borges' protagonists
* Stakes


- One must again be careful with the implication that non-fiction is separate from reality. It is of course, part of this thing. Like a map, or a little model of the solar system. At sufficient resolution, there is a point of the map in which we find the map itself.
- perspective of the protagonists

That is, between reality itself, and the collective works of non-fiction. Even without diminishing the authority of non-fictional claims, this model 

 that the confrontation in question does not occur directly between what is real and what is not (which would presumably be a very uneven match), but rather between two conflicting systems of texts that both claim the status of non-fiction. 

Whereas a fictional text is not constrained by the requirement to represent and be measured against the objects and events it describes, the texts of non-fiction are beholden to an external measure by which true statements are distinguished from fabrications. The reckoning is what reveals which is which. 

How, then, does this reckoning work? What is its mechanism and what are its consequences? It may be tempting to postpone this question---that is, to put off the question of proof or reckoning altogether and to say simply that whatever the consequences, Trump's fabrications will yet remain mere fictions, lies, propaganda, and their truth or falsity is independent of any demonstration. The problem with this position is that it implies, seemingly by accident, that reality is a thing that can be ignored on a very large scale after all. Without a reckoning, the objective world and our preferred representation of it can remain permanently in conflict. If this is the case there is no way to elevate non-fiction.

This matters because what we are calling non-fiction could also be understood as "knowledge", "facts" or "truth." While this humble system of texts may not affect the movement of heavenly bodies, it very much does affect human decisions and behavior on individual, national and global scale. I do not believe we can change the temperature of the sun by altering our records, but if one's goal is merely to take over the world, it is sufficient to control what people believe to be true. Thus it is unquestionably possible for a sweeping campaign of propaganda to achieve this purpose. It is even possible in the case of pandemic, that avatar of reality that appears to defeat all rhetoric.

Surely a disease with hundreds of millions of reported cases worldwide and millions of deaths is as direct representative of a grim reality as we are ever likely to contend with, totally indifferent to political positions or opinions. This is the case where the Trump administration's strategy of treating everything like a public relations problem was sure to fail. There is an argument to be made that this is what happened. Yet, even if this strategy fell short, it is important to acknowledge how effective it was. After all, if the conflict here really was simply between a fiction and reality, we should expect it to fail utterly. Instead, we have an ongoing situation in which pandemic protocols have been politicized, and an enormous portion of the population is refusing vaccination on the basis of political identity. How is this possible?
 
The problem is that, as in the Borges story, we have again fallen into the trap of speaking from the perspective of a person who has already accepted a particular system of texts, a particular narrative as the true representatives of reality. Like Borges's protagonists, it seems to us as if the real world is being invaded. It is very easy to slip into this way of thinking, in which we fail to distinguish between the idea of the world and the world itself. When we do this we imagine that everything we know is somehow immediately obvious---as though presented through a direct experience---and we forget the mechanisms by which we acquired this view. We easily forget how little individuals can directly perceive, and how much we rely on external sources of information. We forget, perhaps most importantly, how much we rely on trust and identity when chosing between conflicting sources.  
  
But here again the pandemic provides and instructive example of exactly the kind of phenomenon that, due to the enormity of the scale on which it operates, one cannot directly perceive. One cannot simply extrapolate from personal experience to attain the kind of national or global insights required to "perceive" a pandemic. Even if there were some way of making this extrapolation, we still have to contend with the variable reliability of our own faculties---one of the major lessons we can learn from direct experience. It follows that the only way to "see" the pandemic is therefore through some kind of mediation.

What this means, to be clear, is that the relevant conflict is not between Trump and reality, but between two conflicting systems of text, both of which claim to be non-fiction. That is, both of which claim to have a special, privileged relationship to reality that authorizes their designation as non-fiction. This special relationship is what makes a reckoning possible, and moments of reckoning are what ultimately distinguish fact from fiction.
Thus both side await the reckoning.
Thus, both sides agree on this framing, and disagree only about which is which.

---

So again, how will it occur?

Does it mean the failure of Trump's political goals? Surely not. After all, he was elected to the presidency.

Does it mean the eventual demonstration of falsity of some portion of his claims? 
  * Does this rely on persuasion? Of whom? Consensus? Majority?
  * Consider conspiracy theory phenomenon--exactly at the heart of the problem.

Is it, as Ayn Rand suggests in Atlas Shrugged, a process of natural selection?

What if we are not guaranteed a reckoning?

What is the process for admiting a claim into the canon of non-fiction?

Scientific method?

Can we distinguish based on reason, examining the internal consistency?

In this case Borges does much better than Trump. For while Trump makes very little effort to maintain consistency, Borges delivers an extremely consistent world view, one which is based on the work of a very earnest philosophy.

What this means:

Suspicion of the reckoning narrative is warranted.
We are not on very solid ground.
It is not just a matter of "verifying facts" on the internet or getting a better education.
We are not guaranteed a reckoning. Consequently, the texts of non-fiction are vulnerable to the Trumpist assault. 
What to make of the surprisingly important role of aesthetics and desires?

How to explain Borges's joke?
* We'll need more background.
* Makes sense to explain how this connects to metaphysics.

---

Later:
* As reality changes, so does what is "realistic."
* Something very like Kuhn's paradigms.
* Similarly, like Derrida's explanation of reciprocal destruction of philosophical systems.

## The Philosophy of Tlon
* Berkeley's subjective idealism
* Minus God
* In Tlon, the cause is produced by the effect. The Hron. They have even industrialized this phenomenon.
* The explanation is called into being by empirical observation. Thus the world grows leonem ex ungue. The cabal that is responsible for the world is discovered inevitably to explain it, but what is the motivation of these conspirators? They exist to explain the encyclopedia article, which in turn exists to explain the memory of a quotation.

A correction of the kind discussed above might mean the discovery of evidence that makes the fiction unsustainable. But only a passing familiarity with the conspiracy cult that surrounded Trump should be enough to demonstrate that nearly any belief can be sustained in the face of nearly any evidence, provided there is sufficient will. Theories that make predictions that don't come to pass are quick to adapt.

This is a more reasonable interpretation, but in this case, we should attend to the details of how this demonstration is supposed to occur, and who is supposed to arbitrate the conflict. Trump's opponents are convinced already. Is the idea that Trump's supporters themselves would be persuaded by some overwhelming show of evidence? Who could still imagine there was any such guarantee?
...

Theories that make predictions that don't come to pass are quick to adapt.

Another possibility is an empirical, near-Darwinian (Randian) interpretation, in which the adherents of one theory or another are eliminated through a process of natural selection. Wild as this seems, it appears to be playing out in the current vaccination wars. Yet, there is no natural law that guarantees that the negative consequences of a person's decisions would be confined to the person who made the decision. Far from it---as the similar study of global warming very clearly indicates, the behavior of a significant majority could eliminate all of us. If this is what is meant by reality asserting itself then it is small comfort. Clearly it would be preferable not to run this experiment at scale.

even worse: no correlation to survival-- What is the ant's theory of gravity? Or a negative correlation: an incorrect belief that makes survival more likely. 

What if identity is more important than survival? Or, conversely that giving up identity is a worse kind of death.

In this scenario, there is no 

* win the argument
* win by natural selection
* try skipping consequences
* there is some natural affinity between non-fiction and reality

If this seems like a problem, then it turns out that the conflict was never between reality and fiction, but between fiction and nonfiction. That is, we have to refine our model of the conflict. It is a conflict between two systems of texts, both of which claim to be the true representative of an underlying reality. To believe in the correction narrative is to believe that "the truth will out." False statements will eventually be shown to be false. Or at least, given enough false statements, a dissonance will emerge that allows us (someone?) to recognize their falsity. 

If this is the case, Trump's plan could achieve its highest goals: the inconvenient facts of the world could be pretended away. What thi

Failure could mean that the truth will out---that by some process false statements are eventually revealed to be false. 

Is this true? Is the correction narrative the distinction? If we accept that the contest is between reality and fiction, then it seems the correction narrative must be the distinction, because if fiction could take over reality, it wasn't reality. This is what the protagonists of the Borges story learned.

And yet, are we really so confident that Donald Trump could not have prevailed? Not simply in maintaining power, but in permanently altering the record of what happened. In changing the historical record of what were the "facts"?

It must be obvious by now that he could have won. That no natural law would have prevented it. To establish this is already to win a certain concession: the status quo that he challenged was not "reality" itself, but merely its self-appointed chroniclers. 

Problems:
* Minor: complacency
* Major: What basis for believing this narrative?
  * What obligation does reality have to assert itself?
  * What use is this belief? 
  * What was the basis for authority in the first place?
    * Where did the first world come from?

  * both sides can make this claim
  * If Trump had one we would learn we were not in the kind of world we thought we lived in.

The difficulties are surely not lost on Borges. To engage with these questions is to discover we are not in the kind of world we thought we lived in.

What the narrative boils down to is that Trump's defeat was an example of reality conquering a self-serving fantasy. It is comforting after the fact.

The first problem is that both sides in a political contest always claim that their own version of reality is the true one. 

Likewise, if Trump had succeeded we also would have learned we live in a different kind of world.

This revised interpretation provides a better model for understanding the phenomenon of Trump. It is only as a convenient simplification and crude hyperbole that we can speak of a clean line between Trump world and the real world.

Of course, it is only as a provisional and convenient approximation that we divide the story into its realistic and unrealistic phases, both of which are intertwined together to form a single text. 

The fact that this is easy to forget this was surely not lost on Borges. He makes use of our expectations by setting us up to imagine the world in one way and then gradually introducing information that makes this initial conception impossible to sustain. Rather than a contest between two separate worlds, we have really a kind of power struggle over what ideas and representations are understood as authoritative.

Even this is not quite right, since the world of Tlon is part of the story.

* Binary: And of course, both the fantastic and realistic narratives are part of the same text, and it is only as a temporary and convenient approximation that we discuss a clear division between them.
* This contest of logics is a better way of thinking about what is happening.
* New paragraph: So it is also with respect to Donald Trump. Only as hyperbole or convenient approximation can we talk about separate universes.
* Just as the story of Tlon really exists, so does Donald Trump the man, and so does the National Enquirer and the Apprentice. What we have instead is a lot of texts struggling to establish a logic that supports them. This is not to imply equality, but the grounds for asserting superiority are complex. Much is based on aesthetics, and this is genuinely a contest of etiquette that can be fairly charged as elitist.

Thus, many maintained a faith that there would eventually and inevitably be some kind of "correction." And with Trump's universe now seemingly in retreat, this correction narrative seems poised to reassert itself. A narrative that claims things like infectious diseases can't be conjured away with inventive press releases, and the decision to collectively ignore them will be rebuffed by our collective elimination. Small comfort. Clearly it would be preferable not to wait for such an intervention. And the political advantage of the claim that reality itself will assure an outcome always carries a danger of encouraging inaction.

despite the obvious very real effects on the behavior and decisions of a large portion of the population,
this kind of reality oddly excludes the texts themselves, the really existing tabloid pages, and the real effects of the narratives they contain, like human beings refusing to get vaccinated, accept election results, react to global warming, etc. That is, it either excludes them or attempts to contain them all under the umbrella of what will eventually be corrected.

Yet, we should be skeptical of this narrative for other reasons. 
* First, there is no basis for imaging that reality is guaranteed to assert itself, but a great deal of evidence suggesting that human beings are capable of sustaining an uncorrobated fantasy for a very long time. It has even been put forward, with some merit, that delusion is inseparable from the concept of the human.
* Second, although we may believe that one set of ideas is more correct than another, it is outrageous to assert this without argument. To allow this is to allow it for any set of ideas. Morevover, until the argument is made, we are not dealing with truth against lies, but two networks of claims about the world.
  * Provisionally, then, what we have is not the true believers against the heretics, but one readership against another.

Borges's parable anticipates this already. A careful reader will note that it is not a story of fantasy against reality, but one fictional world against another. The first, the world in which the story begins, invokes the names and places of the non-fiction world, but it is a fiction nonetheless.

Similarly, in the case of Trump, we have a contest between fundamentally the same kinds of things. Whatever their differences, they are both still bodies of texts and claims. It is not an easy task to explain why one should be preferred over another, especially against self-interest. We should not underestimate this.

* Third, we cannot make the argument.
  * Along with this, we should be suspicious of the idea that the problem is one of education. At least if this is meant to indicate that more education allows one to more easily distinguish truth from falsity. The underlying problem is really one of aesthetics and motivations. An educational program intended to address this problem cannot stop at empirical claims; it must address the motivations of the actors producing these claims and the implications of the world view the claims support. In other words, we must describe the politics of our beliefs as part of the argument for accepting them.
  * More briefly, these conclusions call for a certain kind of educational program that is not restricted to discussion of allegedly neutral information. This is exactly the kind of program that departments of the humanities have been developing for at least some 50 years now, and which a hostile, Trumpist mob attempts to gather and attack under the blunt label of critical race theory.
  * It is good politics to pretend--or better, believe--that one is merely the neutral servant of a higher power, merely the messenger of a factual reality, neutrally reporting. That is, that the interests and desires that drive the behavior of the speaker play no role in determining what is spoken.
  * We will see that this political stance is at least as old as Plato. 

Borgesian joke--where does this go?
---
Not just because it seems to encourage complacency (this is always the danger of a propaganda strategy that claims the desired outcome is inevitable), or because it underestimates the threat, but because it fails totally to explain the basis on which we imagine that there is any such guarantee. On the contrary, there is neither evidence not reasoning to demonstrate that humanity on the whole is not capable of sustaining a state of permanent war with reality. It may be the case that the notion of the human is tied inextricably to such a war.  

But another problem is that reality is not on the battlefield.

* And already this narrative has found its own sizable audience: 
* The problem with this narrative is that it also supports a kind of complacency that Trump exploited
  * an underestimating of the fantastic or the ridiculous. 
  * An underestimation of language.
* Small comfort. They could take us all with them.
* But worse, it really is unclear on what basis we imagine that there would be such a guarantee.
* Along with this, we should be suspicious of the idea that the problem is one of education.
* What we have is not the true believers against the heretics, but one readership against another.

The Borgesian joke: prefer Berkeley's world.

---
Closer inspection reveals this is not the conflict that too

* We have to acknowledge that these representations are important.
* What is being defended is not reality itself, but its textual surrogate.
* This surrogate is not self-maintaining. It requires defense.
* We know that the world can be conquered this way because that's how we built it in the first place.

* one readership against another

* Not fantasy and reality, but two systems of text that are both very much part of the physical world, and have the ability to affect the bodies that move in this world.

The protagonists of Tlon:
* Begin in a realistic universe (in which places and names correspond to those of reality), which is to say they match non-fiction texts.
* Increasingly diverge.
* But remember both worlds are a fiction. Simply one fictional world taking over another. 

The Borgesian joke:
* Berkeley's idealism without Berkeley's God.
* The status of what is real is exactly what is in question. Borges creates a situation in which the fantasy world subscribes to a metaphysics that allows it to see itself as more real and more legitimate than the world it is replacing.
* As if to answer the question, "what if there were a planet of people who found Berkeley's arguments convincing"?
* A joke, but a serious joke. A joke with serious implications.
* Rooted in a critique of metaphysics that pits idealism against empiricism. 
* The point is that at a very deep level the arbitrator is not reason but desire.

How did Trump do it?
He is a figure who rose out of supermarket tabloids to achieve prominence in the universe of reality television.
These outlets have in common that he was able to control what they said about him and the world.
He could pay to kill unfavorable stories, and he could write the narrative to portray an image of himself that he considered desirable.

Relation to metaphysics
* The goal has always been to prevent this from happening.
* The securing of the foundations is necessary for the distinction between knowledge and belief.
* It doesn't work.



Before one can move beyond shock and denial and begin to formulate a response, we must first understand what is contested.

Admit that it requires defense. 

based on how it is represented in language. This is not to minimize the threat, but rather to be a little more accurate about the battleground, which is not "reality itself" but its textual surrogate, the media in which it is represented, the mechanisms and institutions by which these representations are generated and authorized, the sanctioned procedures for registering disputes and resolving conflict in this representation.

Without this note, it is difficult to move beyond a state of shock and denial. Too easy to underestimate the real danger of the Trump-led attack. Too easy to misunderstand the way that language and representation are themselves a real part of the world they mediate, and have the consequences of physical forces and suffering. What _appeared_ as a conflict between reality in fantasy is better modeled as a conflict between two audiences who attributed final authority to different sets of texts.  

TLON and the serious JOKE:

So it was also with Borges' heroes, unaware that they were 
In Borges's story the invaders have a point: the entire action takes place within fiction. What looks like fiction overtaking reality is actually one fictional universe replacing another, albeit more "realistic" one.

More accurately, one readership pitted against another.

then led this fictional universe and its devoted audience in an massive assault against a system of nonfictional texts believed by many to be out of bounds:

In doing so he began with a system of texts that, largely because of their unserious status, he could influence. Then attempted to apply this same approach to ever more authoritative sources of information.

* Used this to gain enough power to expand.
* Eventually began a total assault on reality

The only thing new about this is the scale of the assault and the speed with which it achieved or nearly achieved many of its goals. It neither began with Donald Trump nor ended with his presidency. The current furor over "critical race theory" represents the latest front in this war.

Borges's joke hinges on the fact that the value system of the imaginary world of Tlon was one in which ideal existence is prioritized over empirical evidence---a parody of Berkeley's idealism, with the modification that it is not grounded by the omniscient gaze of Berkeley's God. 

The joke is that the imaginary world employs a standard of evidence that causes it to consider itself more real than the world it is displacing. From the perspective of the protagonists, who seem to live in our world (at least in the beginning), the world of Tlon is a fiction because it cannot be empirically experienced.

The key is Hume's critique of Berkeley. What if there was a person who found Berkeley's view _preferable_.

The problem is that the foundations of knowledge, the first assumptions, cannot be established through reasoning. They must be asserted by force. And the powers that determine this force are the desires or aesthetics that precede reason. Powers that emerge out of the psyche. Which in turn is produced by some kind of purely mechanical process that we might today characterize as a kind of ancient writing---writing that took place before there was a notion of language or letters.

A figure of the text that took advantage of the pliability of certain disreputable sources of information.

Trump generated a whole reality that attempted in earnest to swallow this world.

The reason we know this to be a threat is that it has happened before. This vulnerability has already been exploited. It is not a new threat, but the repetition of a strategy that has worked well in the past.

Strategies for attaining authority.

Strike at the root.
The Viceroy, or forging the origin. Erase the author.
Critical mass.

"sticks and stones"
The irony that it is exactly the importance of language that is being denied as a strategy to elevate the effectiveness of language in installing propaganda. This is part of a more general technique for establishing authority, in which one erases the source of the message.

## The idea of reality

The system of hearing oneself speak, which creates the idea of the self and also in some sense gives rise to the idea of the world. That which is not self. What is beyond the system.

And what can we say about it. This problem that the idea of reality really is an idea, even if it is thought to be a thing from which all ideas emerge.

## The idea of reality
The problem is that reality, no matter who complains, is an idea. It may be an idea of a thing that produces the creature that perceives it as an idea. But it at the same time can never escape its ideality.

Say again: I have a thought of the world, and the world I imagine is one that precedes and encompasses me, though I am the one who thinks it.


The problem of epistemological foundations.

How do we know what we know. It goes all the way back to this system.

This moment of erasing the system that produces the voice. A more primordial writing.


## Goal
The point of this paper is to explain the continued relevance of the poststructural critique of metaphysics in understanding the current intellectual and political moment. For a variety of reasons, the flurry of new ideas that came into and profoundly affectly the humanities in the late 20th century have not been fully processed. They continue to give the impression of disconnected phenomenon. I believe this is an effect of the unfolding process of knowledge production in the humanities. Any particular theory can only have a limited amount of time before it no longer captures the academic imagination, and thus no longer can be the name of the study. Moreover, the theory was difficult to understand and overwhelming in its implications. So what has happened is that the portions with the most obvious material applications were spun off into new studies, integrated into standpoint theory, or decolonial studies. 

But in some cases, old problems continue to trouble us. We see again and again the reinscription of the logocentric gesture. We are perplexed by phenomena that we have a theory to describe. 

two main factors: first, a series of quick insights overwhelmed the academic world, second the academic world is beholden to certain structural constraints. These are usually described in terms of disciplinarity but they also exert their influence in a temporal dimension by limiting the amount of time and energy that can be spent on any one theory. Some of this is an unfortunate manifestation of "funding structure" but some, surely, represents a more general tendency to lose interest in the familiar. The trick of reinvigorating the familiar world, breaking the hypnosis of the ordinary, is the purview of the artist. As is the converse trick: bringing the ordinary into being in the first place. We are caught in the contest of these castings.

In other words, there is a relentless need in academia to push forward to new ideas and coin new

## Ethics behind this metaphysics:
Say one adopts a community-focused ethics: what does one get in return?
The question reveals I am not really talking about a community-focused ethics. I'm talking only about the satisfaction of personal desires. This is all way back to Plato.
Say one is motivated by selfish goals. This seems necessary because the self is the location of experience.
These include perhaps the goal of having a good feeling produced by helping another person. Or the good feeling of accomplishing something that is good for the community.
The good feeling of acting in a way that is calculated to produce the most happiness for the most people.
There are many rational courses of action that do not prioritize what is traditionally considered selfish motives.

Return to the prisoner's dilemma.
If A and B betray each other, 2 years in prison.
If A betrays B but B remains silent, A is free and B gets 3 years.
If B betrays A but B remains silent, B is free and A gets 3 years.
If both remain silent, both get one year.

Now imagine A and B are in love and their goal is to be reunited: this resolves the dilemma. It is obvious what a rational person would do.

More generally, imagine the prisoner's goal is to minimize the total amount of prison time, making no distinction between their own time and the other's. Again, there is now no rational reason for betrayal. 
Any betrayal will result in a total prison time of 3 or 4 years.

Such value systems are so commonplace in the real world that it is bizarre that the dilemma assumes they are not operating. It would be better termed the criminal's dilemma, given the assumption about how the prisoners make decisions. Crucially, there is an implied equivalence between this criminal, self-only ethics and "rationality."
