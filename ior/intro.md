# Fake News, Reality TV: The Signature of Donald Trump
```{quote}
Hume noted for all time that Berkeley's arguments did not admit the slightest refutation nor did they cause the slightest conviction.

## Tlon and Trump
* Two parallel stories of a fantasy world overthrowing reality
* The fictitious world of Tlon, existing in the literature of the nonexistent Uqbar
* The figure of Donald Trump as portrayed in tabloids and reality TV
* On closer inspection, not fantasy vs reality

### First distinction
* "reality" should be invulnerable to imaginary threats
* A closer look reveals this is not in conflict with what happened in either case 
* In the case of Trump, it is not reality, but our understanding of it that is contested
  * The texts of non-fiction that contain the record of the episteme 
  * The institutions that produce and maintain this record
  * A conflict of readerships

### Borgesian joke
* In the case of Tlon, we do well to remember that the original world is not the real world, but merely realistic
  * It corresponds to the texts of non-fiction, but is not bound by any higher laws
  * So as the two worlds diverge we see one fictional world overtake the other.
* The crux of the joke:
  * the belief system of Tlon is one that prioritizes ideality over empirical evidence
  * Thus, from the perspective of Tlon, they have the stronger claim
  * Since both worlds are fiction, they have a point!
  * But the root of the joke goes deep into the heart of western philosophy, in which Borges was well-versed
  * He choses Berkeley's idealism, but without a deity to gaurantee consistency across different subjective experiences of the world. 
  * The idea is to answer the question "What if we were to imagine a society that, unlike Hume, found Berkeley's arguments compelling"
  * This last piece of the fiction escapes the fictional world, and crosses the boundary into the philosophy of the west

### Return to Trump
* The increasing divergence of readerships
* Not just a matter of ignorance, as both sides prefer to claim.
* It would be comforting to think so.
* Nor is it exactly a problem of creeping "politicization"
* Rather, a recognition even on a subconscious level of the role of politics, aesthetics, desires in the construction of the episteme

### Goals 
* Continued relevance of the critique of metaphysics
* Integrate more of the lost ideas

## Tlon and Trump

Jorge Luis Borges's Tlon, Uqbar Orbis Tertius, tells the story of protagonists who discover, through an apocryphal article in a counterfeit encyclopedia, a vast imaginary world that eventually invades and subsumes their own reality. The biography of Donald Trump is a modern remake of this tale. He is a figure who rose out of supermarket tabloids to achieve prominence in the universe of reality television, then turned the forces of this fantasy against reality itself.

At least, that is how it seemed to many adherents of the old regime: the readership of the news articles and reportage, scientific studies, academic papers, polls, election results, statutes, rulings and other documents that consitute the inter-connected texts of non-fiction, the collection of genres that endeavored to represent the real world. From the perspective of those who accept these texts as authorative, it appears that reality itself is under attack, and the mutiny against it is all the more outrageous on account of the fact that the word "reality" denotes exactly that which should be both invulnerable and indifferent to such an assault. That is, if it means anything, "reality" should describe that which is beyond the reach of language, unaffected by our representations of it. It seems that anyone who simply adopts a more convenient set of "alternate facts" is destined for comeuppance sooner or later.

Perhaps this is what happened: the pandemic and eventually the election could not be pretended away. And yet, the effort to do so---the decision to take action based on this alternate facts---surely become part of the real world. And more troubling, one must re-evaluate the confidence that reality, whatever it might ultimately be---will eventually reassert itself. This is especially true in the case of events like a pandemic that are too large for any individual to directly experience. It is also true for events like global warming, which are both too large and too slow. Reality has no obligation to "assert itself"; people make assertions about it. 

What we have instead is a system in which people, often gathered into institutions, make assertions about reality. Whether these assertions are or are not correct is a difficult question. These assertions form a kind of interconnected text. The text is disseminated to a readership, the members of which may add their own personal experience, or may decide not to. This system, unlike the indifferent universe it purports to represent, is not self-maintaining. It requires defense.





* We have to acknowledge that these representations are important.
* What is being defended is not reality itself, but its textual surrogate.
* This surrogate is not self-maintaining. It requires defense.
* We know that the world can be conquered this way because that's how we built it in the first place.

* one readership against another

* Not fantasy and reality, but two systems of text that are both very much part of the physical world, and have the ability to affect the bodies that move in this world.

The protagonists of Tlon:
* Begin in a realistic universe (in which places and names correspond to those of reality), which is to say they match non-fiction texts.
* Increasingly diverge.
* But remember both worlds are a fiction. Simply one fictional world taking over another. 

The Borgesian joke:
* Berkeley's idealism without Berkeley's God.
* The status of what is real is exactly what is in question. Borges creates a situation in which the fantasy world subscribes to a metaphysics that allows it to see itself as more real and more legitimate than the world it is replacing.
* As if to answer the question, "what if there were a planet of people who found Berkeley's arguments convincing"?
* A joke, but a serious joke. A joke with serious implications.
* Rooted in a critique of metaphysics that pits idealism against empiricism. 
* The point is that at a very deep level the arbitrator is not reason but desire.

How did Trump do it?
He is a figure who rose out of supermarket tabloids to achieve prominence in the universe of reality television.
These outlets have in common that he was able to control what they said about him and the world.
He could pay to kill unfavorable stories, and he could write the narrative to portray an image of himself that he considered desirable.

Relation to metaphysics
* The goal has always been to prevent this from happening.
* The securing of the foundations is necessary for the distinction between knowledge and belief.
* It doesn't work.



Before one can move beyond shock and denial and begin to formulate a response, we must first understand what is contested.

Admit that it requires defense. 

based on how it is represented in language. This is not to minimize the threat, but rather to be a little more accurate about the battleground, which is not "reality itself" but its textual surrogate, the media in which it is represented, the mechanisms and institutions by which these representations are generated and authorized, the sanctioned procedures for registering disputes and resolving conflict in this representation.

Without this note, it is difficult to move beyond a state of shock and denial. Too easy to underestimate the real danger of the Trump-led attack. Too easy to misunderstand the way that language and representation are themselves a real part of the world they mediate, and have the consequences of physical forces and suffering. What _appeared_ as a conflict between reality in fantasy is better modeled as a conflict between two audiences who attributed final authority to different sets of texts.  

TLON and the serious JOKE:

So it was also with Borges' heroes, unaware that they were 
In Borges's story the invaders have a point: the entire action takes place within fiction. What looks like fiction overtaking reality is actually one fictional universe replacing another, albeit more "realistic" one.


believed by many to constitute the record of the real. 

More accurately, one readership pitted against another.

then led this fictional universe and its devoted audience in an massive assault against a system of nonfictional texts believed by many to be out of bounds:

Likewise the readers of nonfiction were naive to imagine...

then fought relentlessly and with considerable success to replace all other representations of events, the world, and himself.

fought relentlessly and with considerable success to elevate this vision of the world---at first unserious, somewhat disreputable---to become the authoritative representation, replacing all other representations of events, the world, and himself.

In doing so he began with a system of texts that, largely because of their unserious status, he could influence. Then attempted to apply this same approach to ever more authoritative sources of information.

to make these worlds the true ones
but the problem is that he didn't exactly do that.

Then sought to expand the sphere of narratives that he could personally control, and wipe out or overthrow any sources of information that conflicted with his personal desires.

Need to make the connection between reality and record of reality.

What did Trump do:
* Started with texts that were weak enough for him to control.
* Used this to gain enough power to expand.
* Eventually began a total assault on reality

The only thing new about this is the scale of the assault and the speed with which it achieved or nearly achieved many of its goals. It neither began with Donald Trump nor ended with his presidency. The current furor over "critical race theory" represents the latest front in this war.

Borges's joke hinges on the fact that the value system of the imaginary world of Tlon was one in which ideal existence is prioritized over empirical evidence---a parody of Berkeley's idealism, with the modification that it is not grounded by the omniscient gaze of Berkeley's God. 

The joke is that the imaginary world employs a standard of evidence that causes it to consider itself more real than the world it is displacing. From the perspective of the protagonists, who seem to live in our world (at least in the beginning), the world of Tlon is a fiction because it cannot be empirically experienced.

The key is Hume's critique of Berkeley. What if there was a person who found Berkeley's view _preferable_.

The problem is that the foundations of knowledge, the first assumptions, cannot be established through reasoning. They must be asserted by force. And the powers that determine this force are the desires or aesthetics that precede reason. Powers that emerge out of the psyche. Which in turn is produced by some kind of purely mechanical process that we might today characterize as a kind of ancient writing---writing that took place before there was a notion of language or letters.

A figure of the text that took advantage of the pliability of certain disreputable sources of information.

Trump generated a whole reality that attempted in earnest to swallow this world.

The reason we know this to be a threat is that it has happened before. This vulnerability has already been exploited. It is not a new threat, but the repetition of a strategy that has worked well in the past.

Strategies for attaining authority.

Strike at the root.
The Viceroy, or forging the origin. Erase the author.
Critical mass.

"sticks and stones"
The irony that it is exactly the importance of language that is being denied as a strategy to elevate the effectiveness of language in installing propaganda. This is part of a more general technique for establishing authority, in which one erases the source of the message.

## The idea of reality

The system of hearing oneself speak, which creates the idea of the self and also in some sense gives rise to the idea of the world. That which is not self. What is beyond the system.

And what can we say about it. This problem that the idea of reality really is an idea, even if it is thought to be a thing from which all ideas emerge.

## The idea of reality
The problem is that reality, no matter who complains, is an idea. It may be an idea of a thing that produces the creature that perceives it as an idea. But it at the same time can never escape its ideality.

Say again: I have a thought of the world, and the world I imagine is one that precedes and encompasses me, though I am the one who thinks it.


The problem of epistemological foundations.

How do we know what we know. It goes all the way back to this system.

This moment of erasing the system that produces the voice. A more primordial writing.


## Goal
The point of this paper is to explain the continued relevance of the poststructural critique of metaphysics in understanding the current intellectual and political moment. For a variety of reasons, the flurry of new ideas that came into and profoundly affectly the humanities in the late 20th century have not been fully processed. They continue to give the impression of disconnected phenomenon. I believe this is an effect of the unfolding process of knowledge production in the humanities. Any particular theory can only have a limited amount of time before it no longer captures the academic imagination, and thus no longer can be the name of the study. Moreover, the theory was difficult to understand and overwhelming in its implications. So what has happened is that the portions with the most obvious material applications were spun off into new studies, integrated into standpoint theory, or decolonial studies. 

But in some cases, old problems continue to trouble us. We see again and again the reinscription of the logocentric gesture. We are perplexed by phenomena that we have a theory to describe. 

two main factors: first, a series of quick insights overwhelmed the academic world, second the academic world is beholden to certain structural constraints. These are usually described in terms of disciplinarity but they also exert their influence in a temporal dimension by limiting the amount of time and energy that can be spent on any one theory. Some of this is an unfortunate manifestation of "funding structure" but some, surely, represents a more general tendency to lose interest in the familiar. The trick of reinvigorating the familiar world, breaking the hypnosis of the ordinary, is the purview of the artist. As is the converse trick: bringing the ordinary into being in the first place. We are caught in the contest of these castings.

In other words, there is a relentless need in academia to push forward to new ideas and coin new
